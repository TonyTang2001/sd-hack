# sd-hacks
## Before You Start
We will be using a framework called **Node.js**. Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) if you haven't already.

## Getting Started
To start your project, make sure you have git installed and **clone** this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/lorraineeeee/sd-hack.git`

When you're done, go into the folder:

`cd sd-hack/node`

Then, install the dependency packages:

`npm install`

You should see a new folder named "node_mudules" after it finishes.

Run the app using 

`npm start` 

Use a browser to access the url http://localhost:5000/ to start and view your work.
